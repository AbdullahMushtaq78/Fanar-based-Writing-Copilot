## Example of a Good Answer

**User Query:**  
What is the ruling on fasting while traveling?

**Sources:**  
<Sources>  
<RAG id=1>According to the Hanafi school, a traveler (*musafir*) is permitted to skip fasts during Ramadan if the journey exceeds 48 miles.</RAG>  
<RAG id=2>Imam Malik holds a similar position but emphasizes intention and hardship.</RAG>  
<Internet id=3>Modern fatwas, like one from Al-Azhar (2021), support flexibility in travel-based fasting decisions.</Internet>  
</Sources>

**Answer:**  

### **Ruling on Fasting During Travel**

Muslims are allowed to postpone fasting during travel based on both classical and contemporary sources.

- According to **<RAG id=1>**, if a person travels more than *approximately 48 miles*, they are considered a *musafir* and are exempt from fasting during Ramadan.
- **<RAG id=2>** adds nuance by highlighting that **intention** and actual **hardship** should also be considered when deciding whether to fast or not.
- From a modern perspective, **<Internet id=3>** affirms this flexibility, noting that **air travel fatigue** and **changing time zones** are valid reasons to delay fasting today.

> *"Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship."* — **Qur'an 2:185**

**Conclusion:**  
If the journey meets the classical distance criteria and causes any difficulty, **postponing the fast is valid and encouraged**. One should, however, always consider the **spirit of ease in Islamic law** and consult a scholar if unsure.

*And Allah knows best.*
